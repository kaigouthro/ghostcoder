Explanation:

The `roman` function takes an integer `number` as input and returns a string representing the Roman numeral equivalent of the input number.

The function uses a dictionary `roman_numerals` to map the integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral representations. The dictionary is defined outside the function to make it accessible to other functions that may need to use it.

The function then iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary, using the `while` loop to repeatedly add the Roman numeral representation to the `result` string while the input number is greater than or equal to the current key.

Finally, the function returns the `result` string, which contains the Roman numeral representation of the input number.

Note that the function does not handle invalid input, such as negative numbers or numbers greater than 3,999. It is assumed that the input number will always be a valid integer between 1 and 3,999.
