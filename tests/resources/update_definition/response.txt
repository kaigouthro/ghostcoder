Here is the updated code for the tic_tac_toe.py file. I have made the following changes:

1. I have added a new parameter `moves` to the `tic_tac_toe` function. This parameter is a list of strings, where each string represents a move. This change allows us to test the `tic_tac_toe` function by providing it with a list of moves.

2. I have replaced the `input` function with a function that pops the first element from the `moves` list. This change allows us to simulate user input during testing.

3. I have changed the `print` statements that print the game result to `return` statements. This change allows us to capture the game result during testing.

4. I have added a `try`/`except` block around the code that converts the move to a row and column. This change allows us to handle invalid input during testing.
