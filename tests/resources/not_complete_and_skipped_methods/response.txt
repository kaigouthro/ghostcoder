The error messages indicate that there are several issues with the implementation:

1. The test `test_cant_hit_before_ships_placed` is failing because the implementation does not check if all ships are placed before allowing a turn to be taken. This logic needs to be added to the `create_turn` method.

2. The test `test_cant_place_ship_after_all_ships_placed` is failing because the error message does not match the expected error message. The error message needs to be updated to match the expected message.

3. The test `test_turns_and_results` is failing because turns are not being stored in the `turns` list of the `Game` object. This needs to be added to the `create_turn` method.

4. The test `test_game_over_condition` is failing because there are no players in the game. A player needs to be added when a game is created.

Here is the updated code:

/battleship.py
```python
class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    def __init__(self):
        self.games: Dict[str, Game] = {}

    def create_game(self) -> str:
        game_id = str(random.randint(1000, 9999))
        self.games[game_id] = Game(
            game_id=game_id,
            players=["player1"],  # Add a player to the game
            board={},
            ships=[],
            turns=[]
        )
        return game_id

    def create_ship_placement(self, game_id: str, placement: ShipPlacement) -> None:
        game = self.games.get(game_id)
        if not game:
            raise ValueError("Invalid game ID")

        ship_type = placement.ship_type.lower()
        if ship_type not in self.SHIP_LENGTHS:
            raise ValueError("Invalid ship type")

        # Check if all ships have been placed
        if len(game.ships) == len(self.SHIP_LENGTHS):
            raise ValueError("All ships are already placed. Cannot place more ships.")

        # Rest of the code...

    def create_turn(self, game_id: str, turn: Turn) -> TurnResponse:
        game = self.games.get(game_id)
        if not game:
            raise ValueError("Invalid game ID")

        # Check if all ships have been placed
        if len(game.ships) != len(self.SHIP_LENGTHS):
            raise ValueError("All ships must be placed before starting turns")

        # Rest of the code...

        # Add the turn to the game's turns list
        game.turns.append(turn)

        return TurnResponse(result=result, ship_type=ship_type)
```
