## Solution

The problem requires us to convert a given number to its Roman numeral representation. We can solve this problem by using the following rules:

1. The Roman numeral system uses letters to represent numbers. The letters I, V, X, L, C, D, and M represent 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000, respectively.

2. The Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation for numbers greater than 5. For example, 7 is represented as VII (not VI+I).

3. The Roman numeral system uses additive notation for numbers less than 5. For example, 4 is represented as IV (not II+II).

4. The Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation for numbers greater than 50. For example, 90 is represented as XC (not LX).

5. The Roman numeral system uses additive notation for numbers less than 50. For example, 40 is represented as XL (not XLX).

6. The Roman numeral system uses subtractive notation for numbers greater than 500. For example, 900 is represented as CM (not D).

7. The Roman numeral system uses additive notation for numbers less than 500. For example, 400 is represented as CD (not DXX).

We can use these rules to convert any given number to its Roman numeral representation. Here's the Python code to implement this:

```python
def roman(number):
    # Define the symbols for each numeral
    roman_numerals = {
        1000: 'M',
        900: 'CM',
        500: 'D',
        400: 'CD',
        100: 'C',
        90: 'XC',
        50: 'L',
        40: 'XL',
        10: 'X',
        9: 'IX',
        5: 'V',
        4: 'IV',
        1: 'I'
    }

    # Initialize the result string
    result = ''

    # Iterate through the symbols in descending order
    for value, numeral in roman_numerals.items():
        # Determine the number of times the current symbol appears in the number
        count = number // value

        # Add the current symbol to the result string
        result += numeral * count

        # Subtract the value of the current symbol from the number
        number -= value * count

    return result
```

Let's test the function with some sample inputs:

```python
print(roman(1))  # I
print(roman(19))  # XIX
print(roman(1990))  # MCMXC
print(roman(2008))  # MMVIII
```

Output:

```
I
XIX
MCMXC
MMVIII
```

The function works as expected and returns the correct Roman numeral representation for any given number.
