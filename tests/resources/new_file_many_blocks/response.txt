Sure, let's start by creating the `Battleship` class that extends the `AbstractBattleship` class. We'll implement the methods one by one.

First, let's create the `Battleship` class and implement the `create_game` method. This method will initialize a new game with an empty board, no ships, and no turns.

/battleship.py
```python
from typing import Dict, List
from .abstract_battleship import AbstractBattleship, Game, ShipPlacement, Turn

class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    def __init__(self):
        self.games: Dict[str, Game] = {}

    def create_game(self, game_id: str, players: List[str]) -> None:
        if game_id in self.games:
            raise ValueError(f"Game with id {game_id} already exists.")

        board = [["" for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]
        self.games[game_id] = Game(game_id=game_id, players=players, board=board, ships=[], turns=[])
```

In the `create_game` method, we first check if a game with the given id already exists. If it does, we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we create a new `Game` instance with the given id, an empty board, and empty lists for ships and turns. We then add this game to the `games` dictionary, using the game id as the key.

Next, let's implement the `create_ship_placement` method. This method will add a new ship to the game.

/battleship.py
```python
from typing import Dict, List
from .abstract_battleship import AbstractBattleship, Game, ShipPlacement, Turn

class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    # ... previous code ...

    def create_ship_placement(self, game_id: str, placement: ShipPlacement) -> None:
        game = self.games.get(game_id)
        if not game:
            raise ValueError(f"Game with id {game_id} does not exist.")

        ship_length = self.SHIP_LENGTHS[placement.ship_type]
        start_row, start_column = placement.start["row"] - 1, ord(placement.start["column"]) - ord("A")

        if placement.direction == "horizontal":
            if start_column + ship_length > 10:
                raise ValueError("Ship placement is out of bounds.")
            for i in range(ship_length):
                if game.board[start_row][start_column + i] != "":
                    raise ValueError("Ship placement overlaps with another ship.")
                game.board[start_row][start_column + i] = placement.ship_type
        else:  # placement.direction == "vertical"
            if start_row + ship_length > 10:
                raise ValueError("Ship placement is out of bounds.")
            for i in range(ship_length):
                if game.board[start_row + i][start_column] != "":
                    raise ValueError("Ship placement overlaps with another ship.")
                game.board[start_row + i][start_column] = placement.ship_type

        game.ships.append(placement)
```

In the `create_ship_placement` method, we first retrieve the game with the given id. If no such game exists, we raise a `ValueError`. We then calculate the length of the ship and the starting row and column based on the placement. If the ship is placed horizontally, we check if it fits within the board and if it overlaps with any existing ships. If either check fails, we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we place the ship on the board and add the placement to the game's list of ships. We do the same for vertical placements.

Next, let's implement the `create_turn` method. This method will process a player's turn and return the result.

/battleship.py
```python
from typing import Dict, List
from .abstract_battleship import AbstractBattleship, Game, ShipPlacement, Turn, TurnResponse

class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    # ... previous code ...

    def create_turn(self, game_id: str, turn: Turn) -> TurnResponse:
        game = self.games.get(game_id)
        if not game:
            raise ValueError(f"Game with id {game_id} does not exist.")

        row, column = turn.target["row"] - 1, ord(turn.target["column"]) - ord("A")
        if game.board[row][column] == "":
            result = "miss"
            ship_type = None
        else:
            result = "hit"
            ship_type = game.board[row][column]
            game.board[row][column] = ""

        game.turns.append(turn)
        return TurnResponse(result=result, ship_type=ship_type)
```

In the `create_turn` method, we first retrieve the game with the given id. If no such game exists, we raise a `ValueError`. We then calculate the target row and column based on the turn. If the target cell is empty, we set the result to "miss" and the ship type to `None`. Otherwise, we set the result to "hit", retrieve the ship type from the board, and clear the cell. We then add the turn to the game's list of turns and return a `TurnResponse` with the result and ship type.

Next, let's implement the `get_game_status` method. This method will check if the game is over and return the game status.

/battleship.py
```python
from typing import Dict, List
from .abstract_battleship import AbstractBattleship, Game, GameStatus, ShipPlacement, Turn, TurnResponse

class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    # ... previous code ...

    def get_game_status(self, game_id: str) -> GameStatus:
        game = self.games.get(game_id)
        if not game:
            raise ValueError(f"Game with id {game_id} does not exist.")

        is_game_over = all(cell == "" for row in game.board for cell in row)
        winner = game.players[0] if is_game_over else None
        return GameStatus(is_game_over=is_game_over, winner=winner)
```

In the `get_game_status` method, we first retrieve the game with the given id. If no such game exists, we raise a `ValueError`. We then check if all cells on the board are empty, which means the game is over. If the game is over, we set the winner to the first player. Otherwise, we set the winner to `None`. We then return a `GameStatus` with the game over flag and the winner.

Next, let's implement the `get_winner` method. This method will return the winner of the game.

/battleship.py
```python
from typing import Dict, List
from .abstract_battleship import AbstractBattleship, Game, GameStatus, ShipPlacement, Turn, TurnResponse

class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    # ... previous code ...

    def get_winner(self, game_id: str) -> str:
        game_status = self.get_game_status(game_id)
        if not game_status.is_game_over:
            raise ValueError("The game is not over yet.")
        return game_status.winner
```

In the `get_winner` method, we first retrieve the game status with the given id. If the game is not over, we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we return the winner.

Next, let's implement the `get_game` method. This method will return the state of the game.

/battleship.py
```python
from typing import Dict, List
from .abstract_battleship import AbstractBattleship, Game, GameStatus, ShipPlacement, Turn, TurnResponse

class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    # ... previous code ...

    def get_game(self, game_id: str) -> Game:
        game = self.games.get(game_id)
        if not game:
            raise ValueError(f"Game with id {game_id} does not exist.")
        return game
```

In the `get_game` method, we first retrieve the game with the given id. If no such game exists, we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we return the game.

Finally, let's implement the `delete_game` method. This method will delete a game.

/battleship.py
```python
from typing import Dict, List
from .abstract_battleship import AbstractBattleship, Game, GameStatus, ShipPlacement, Turn, TurnResponse

class Battleship(AbstractBattleship):
    # ... previous code ...

    def delete_game(self, game_id: str) -> None:
        if game_id not in self.games:
            raise ValueError(f"Game with id {game_id} does not exist.")
        del self.games[game_id]
```

In the `delete_game` method, we first check if a game with the given id exists. If it does not, we raise a `ValueError`. Otherwise, we delete the game from the `games` dictionary.

That's it! We have now implemented all the methods of the `Battleship` class. You can now use this class to play a game of Battleship.
