# The Mysterious Phonetic Cryptographer
A very unique encryption algorithm has been used to send messages in a clandestine organization. The cipher operates by converting every letter in a string to its corresponding phonetic alphabet representation (e.g., 'a' to 'alpha', 'b' to 'bravo', 'c' to 'charlie', etc.) and then reversing the entire string. Due to a recent turn of events, having a function to decode these messages has become quite essential.

## Instructions
1. Create a decoding function that takes an encoded string as input. This string consists of phonetic alphabets separated by whitespace and arranged in reverse order. Each phonetic alphabet represents a letter of the original message. 
2. Your function must convert the phonetic alphabets back to their corresponding letters and also arrange them in the correct sequence to reconstruct the original string.
3. Remember that the case of the original letters was preserved during encryption, i.e., 'zulu' corresponds to 'z' and 'ZULU' corresponds to 'Z'. Make sure your function handles this appropriately.
4. The function should return the decoded string.

## Constraints
1. The input string will only ever contain valid phonetic alphabet representations.
2. Each word in the string will be separated by a single white space.
3. The input string will not contain punctuation or special characters.
4. The length of the input string will not exceed 10^6 characters.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. The function must correctly decode the input string to retrieve the original string.
2. The function must handle both uppercase and lowercase letters appropriately.
3. The function should execute within a reasonable time for the maximum input size.
