# Coffee Machine Problem 
In a far, far away land, coffee is produced by a unique machine that operates purely on programming codes. This machine has two input compartments - one for coffee beans and one for water. Here's where you come in, you need to write a program that will assist the machine in producing coffee.

## Instructions
1. Define a function that takes in two parameters: one representing the weight of coffee beans (in grams), and the other representing the volume of water (in milliliters). Both parameters will be non-negative integers.
2. The function should evaluate these two inputs and return the maximum number of cups of coffee the machine can produce. Assume that for every cup of coffee, the machine uses 18 grams of coffee beans and 200 milliliters of water. 
3. If there is not enough resources for at least one cup of coffee, the function should return 0. 

## Constraints
1. The input parameters are always natural numbers (positive integers and zero).
2. The function should not use any global variables. 

## Evaluation Criteria
1. The code accurately calculates the maximum number of cups of coffee which the machine can produce.
2. The code does not include any unnecessary elements.
3. The code is clear and easy to understand.
